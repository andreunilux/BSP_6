Bachelor Semester Project 6

This repository is about developing A deep learning-based method for Hate speech detection on social media
content. I use large lanuage models based on the BERT architecture to tackle this problem.



Pre-trained models:
HateBert: https://huggingface.co/GroNLP/hateBERT
Bert Base uncased: https://huggingface.co/bert-base-uncased

Dataset for Training and Testing:
