This repository is about developing A deep learning-based method for Hate speech detection on social media
content. I use large lanuage models based on the BERT architecture to tackle this problem.



## Pre-trained models:

1. HateBert: https://huggingface.co/GroNLP/hateBERT
2. Bert Base uncased: https://huggingface.co/bert-base-uncased

## Dataset for Training and Testing:
1. [data/gold](https://github.com/xinchenyu/counter_context/tree/main/data/gold)
